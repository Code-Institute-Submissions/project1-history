            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>In the early 16th century, the Kalmar Union had tied together the kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden under a single monarch. King Christian II of Denmark, known for his ambition and ruthlessness, ascended to the throne in 1513. He sought to strengthen his control over Sweden, which was experiencing a period of political instability.</p>

            <h2>The Rise of Christian II</h2>
            <p>Christian II was initially welcomed by some Swedish nobles, who saw him as a potential stabilizing force. However, as his rule progressed, he alienated many with his heavy-handed tactics and attempts to centralize power.</p>

            <h2>The Rebellion of Sture Party</h2>
            <p>The Sture Party, led by the influential Sture family, opposed Christian's rule. They had ruled Sweden as regents for many years and aimed to maintain Swedish independence. Conflict between the Sture Party and Christian II escalated, leading to open hostilities.</p>

            <h2>The Siege of Stockholm</h2>
            <p>In 1520, Christian II launched a military campaign to capture Stockholm, a stronghold of the Sture Party. After several months of siege, the city surrendered in September. The defenders hoped for leniency, but Christian had other plans.</p>

            <h2>The Stockholm Bloodbath</h2>
            <p>On November 4, 1520, Christian II invited numerous Swedish nobles and dignitaries to a reconciliation banquet at Stockholm Castle. Promising amnesty and forgiveness, he lured them into a false sense of security. Once the guests were inside the castle, Christian II broke his word.</p>
                
            <p>Christian ordered the arrest of around 80 prominent Swedes, including Gustav Trolle, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who had aligned with him. These individuals were accused of heresy and treason. The following days saw a series of executions, with many nobles and clergy beheaded or hanged. The exact number of victims is debated, but it's estimated that as many as 80 to 100 people were killed.</p>

            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p>The Stockholm Bloodbath shocked Sweden and Europe, tarnishing Christian II's reputation. The event deepened the rift between Sweden and Denmark, fueling resentment against Danish rule. It also played a role in fostering Swedish nationalism and the eventual liberation of Sweden from the Kalmar Union in 1523.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>The Stockholm Bloodbath remains a symbol of betrayal and brutality in Swedish history and is often cited as a key event that contributed to the country's drive for independence. It's a powerful example of the consequences of political manipulation and broken promises.</p>
